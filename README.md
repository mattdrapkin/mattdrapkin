## üëã About Me

Hi there! I'm Matt Drapkin, a Computer Science student at Princeton University with a minor in Statistics and Machine Learning. My interests lie primarily in full-stack engineering and entrepreneurship.

Some of my favorite classes I've taken at Princeton include Advanced Programming Techniques, Computer Vision, and Research Projects in Data Science. I am most excited to take Computer Architecture and Principles of Blockchains in the fall, when I'll get practice with C++ and Rust.

## üíº Experience

### PRINCO Investment Analyst (NJ)
This summer, I wanted to gain exposure to some of the best and brightest in the entrepreneurship world. Working as an Investment Analyst at Princeton University Investment Company (PRINCO), I am learning to analyze financial models and conduct due diligence on hedge funds and VC's. I am grateful to have the chance to meet with founders, CEO's, and seasoned investors as I help manage the largest university endowment per student in the U.S.

### Amazon SDE (NYC)
Deployed large-scale machine learning systems to enhance the Amazon Catalog's accuracy, working with technologies like Java, JUnit, Apache Spark, and AWS services like EMR and S3. Calibrated a SageMaker Batch Transform Model to reach 95% precision before autopublishing to online catalog.

### Thales SDE (PA)
Unit testing, Behavior Driven Development, and secure web application development for Smart Card management tools.

### R&D Engineer at CUbits.ai
Designed an ed-tech interface used by over 300 students across multiple universities in React and Redux.

## üí° Projects

### Locked: The AI E-reader
Developed an AI-enhanced e-reader that integrates OpenAI's GPT engine to prompt users with quiz questions, promoting active recall and spaced repetition study strategies. This project involved React, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS S3, among other technologies.

### Image Super Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks
Implemented and evaluated a Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN), demonstrating significant improvements in image quality. Developed with Python and Keras.

### inFormal (Clothing Marketplace)
Led a startup focused on sustainability, creating a platform for students to borrow and lend clothes. Built on Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and JS/jQuery, the app was recruited by TigerApps, a Princeton-specific web application platform, to recieve extra resources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills

I'm proficient in several programming languages including Java, C, Python, JavaScript, Golang, C#, R, SQL. I also have experience with frameworks and tools like React, Flask, Express.js, jQuery, NumPy, Pandas, Svelte, Selenium, Apache Spark, and Tidymodels.

## üåü Interests

Beyond my professional interests, I love playing basketball and currently serve as the captain of the Men‚Äôs Club Basketball team. I'm also involved in various student organizations such as Business Brilliance, Chabad Student Board, Entrepreneurship Club, The Daily Princetonian Newspaper, Hack4Impact, and Tiger Inn.
